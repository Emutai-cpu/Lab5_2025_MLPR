# Lab5_2025_MLPR
This for MLPR course 2026 spring lab5

Methodology
I used face recognition xml file haart to detect the faces and take them out of the picture to compare on the Graph
They were put on the graph on the basis of hue and saturation.

Findings
While I was unable to put Mr. Shashi Tharorr's photo in one of the clusters I found his is rather outlying all cluster which leads me to believe i made a mistake in the process.
His location is to the farthest right showing highest saturation of all.

Conclusion
I have successfully added Mr Shashi's photo to the cluster of faculty in the campus and it stands out from the rest signifying the the photo was taken from a place completely different from the setting where the faculty did

It was on a difficult subject of photo analysis and classification, here are some photos.
